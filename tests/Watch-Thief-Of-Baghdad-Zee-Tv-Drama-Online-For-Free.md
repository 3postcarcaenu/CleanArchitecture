Thief Of Baghdad Zee Tv Drama Online is based on the Arabian Nights story, which is a collection of folk tales from the Middle East and South Asia.

However, the show also has its own twists and turns that make it unique and captivating.
 
The show has a total of 260 episodes, which are divided into four seasons. The first season introduces Ali and his friends, who are a group of street urchins who survive by stealing and conning. Ali also meets Zehra, the princess of Baghdad, who is disguised as a commoner. They fall in love, but their relationship is opposed by Jafar, the evil vizier who wants to marry Zehra and take over the throne. Jafar also has a secret alliance with a powerful witch named Zalimah, who helps him with her dark magic.
 
The second season focuses on Ali's journey to find his true identity and his connection to the legendary King Solomon. He learns that he is the chosen one who can wield the magic ring of Solomon, which grants him immense power and wisdom. He also discovers that he has a twin brother named Omar, who is working for Jafar and Zalimah. Ali faces many challenges and enemies along the way, such as a giant bird called Roc, a fire-breathing dragon, a cursed mummy, and a shape-shifting snake.
 
The third season deals with Ali's battle against Jafar and Zalimah, who have unleashed a horde of demons and monsters on Baghdad. Ali also reunites with Zehra, who has been kidnapped by Jafar and brainwashed by Zalimah. Ali has to save Zehra and restore her memory, as well as protect Baghdad from the evil forces. He also meets new allies, such as a fairy named Parizaad, a genie named Jinoo, and a warrior princess named Shehzadi.
 
The fourth season shows Ali's final confrontation with Jafar and Zalimah, who have obtained the ultimate weapon: the Book of Shadows. The book contains all the secrets of the universe and can grant any wish. Jafar and Zalimah use the book to create havoc and chaos in Baghdad and beyond. Ali has to stop them before they destroy everything he loves. He also has to face his own inner demons and overcome his doubts and fears.
